            My name is Kelton Tracy. At the time of creating this, I am a college student at Brigham Young University - Idaho.
            This website is meant to be a portfolio of mine, so that my future employers (possibly you) can have a glimpse of 
            my abilities and accomplishments. This site was coded completely by me, and includes pages showing off my accomplishments 
            and my hobbies.

            Although this will most likely change within the next few years, at this time, I have worked for two different companies.
            The first was a restaurant known as Scotty's Drive-In. This place was a high pressure environment as, although it was 
            not a fast food restaurant, it shared many similarities with one, which meant that the employees were encouraged to
            work fast and efficiently. The second company I have worked for was FedEx. While here, my main job was as a 
            Package Handler, which meant that I would take packages from trucks and planes and push them onto the main line 
            where they would then get sorted. Although that was my main responsibility, I also would organize package cards 
            so that others would be able to easily sort the packages where they needed to go.
