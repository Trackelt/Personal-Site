        ABOUT
        My name is Kelton Tracy. At the time this was written, I am currently a college student at Brigham Young University Idaho.
        However, I suspect that at the point that this is read, I will no longer be a college student and may be approaching you
        for a career.

        CAREERS
        Although this may need to be updated in the future, at the time of writing this, I have worked for two different companies.
        The first was a restaurant known as "Scotty's Drive-In" and I worked there for about two years.
        While there, I worked as the Fryer, and overtime took on more responsibilities, and when I left, I was one of the people 
        in charge of cooking the burgers and other main dishes.

        After finishing high school, I spent about half of a year working at FedEx. Although I did not deliver packages for them, 
        I did do most of the grunt work, which was mostly taking packages on or off of a plane and organizing where they go.
        I also was the one in charge of preparing things so that all of the drivers would have an easier time sorting packages.

      <h3>Accomplishments</h3>
      <p>
        EAGLE SCOUT
        While I am still young, I do not have too many accomplishments, however, I still do have some.
        Perhaps the most impressive is that I am an Eagle Scout. For my Eagle Project, I organized a group of people and 
        repainted a bunch of fire hydrants in an area.

        SERVICE MISSION
        Another impressive accomplishment I have achieved is that I served a Service Mission for the Church of Jesus Christ
        of Latter Day Saints. For this, I spent two years serving others at various places. Some of the most notable 
        are the Bishop's Storehouse, the Humanitarian Center, and the Ronald Mcdonald Family Rooms, doing many different tasks.

      <h3>Hobbies</h3>
      <p>
        VIDEO GAMES
        One of my favorite hobbies is video gaming. I have been interested in this since I was a child, and so have spent a lot of
        my life learning from these games. My favorite game series is the Dark Souls Series, which is infamous for being an incredibly
        difficult game series. A big part of why I love this series is because in the games, you have to learn how to adapt to
        different situations so that you can progress through the games.

        BOOKS
        Another hobby that is very important to me is reading books. I have been reading since I was very young, and therefore have 
        quite a bit of experience with it and with the English language. My favorite author is Brandon Sanderson, and I have read
        the majority of his published books.
