            One of my favorite hobbies is playing video games. There are many different games which I enjoy playing, but the series
            which is my favorite is the Dark Souls Series. This series is infamous for being an incredibly difficult game series.
            Part of why it is infamous, and part of why I love it, is because to fight enemies in the game, you have to learn 
            how to fight them by observing their attacks and figuring out the best times to attack them yourself.

            Another one of my favorite hobbies is to read books. I have been doing this from a very young age, and 
            am considered to be very well read. My favorite author is Brandon Sanderson, who has written many great books.
